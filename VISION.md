# Vision & Philosophy

## 1. Global Idea

Many professional teams — from small businesses to large enterprises — need to build and maintain reliable, production-grade Kubernetes clusters. Yet, the abundance of tools, "best practices", and commercial solutions makes it challenging to:

- Stay unbiased and make decisions not driven by vendor interests.
- Build platforms that are reproducible, scalable, and portable (no lock-in).
- Understand *why* to pick solution X or Y based on context, not hype or inertia.

### Our Mission

To provide a transparent, **independent guide and framework** for designing and evolving Kubernetes platforms — driven by real experience, open-source mindset, and community review.

## 2. Rationale & Principles

- **Transparency & Honesty**: All recommendations are based on hands-on experience and clear reasoning. When uncertain, we call it out.
- **Exit Strategy & Lock-in Awareness**: Every tool is reviewed for vendor dependence risks and migration options.
- **SAFe-inspired Scalability**: As SAFe provides structure for agile scaling, our framework adapts for small-to-large setups, from single teams to enterprise.
- **Role- & Goal-Oriented**: Decisions are explained per perspective: cluster admin, engineering/dev team, architect, and per business/operational goal.

---

## 3. Principles

- **Honesty over completeness**: Better to cover 10 tools deeply than 50 superficially.
- **Declare uncertainty**: If something wasn't tested, state it.
- **Principles above tools**: Focus on reproducible, scalable, and robust patterns. Tools change, foundations remain.
- **SAFe-inspired structure**: Role × goal × domain → decision matrix → gold path.

---

## 4. Future Extensions

- Benchmarking tools per domain.
- Reusable decision templates.
- Publication of gold paths, with optional and required pieces.
- (Planned) Interactive web tools for the decision matrix.

**This document serves as a living roadmap for KubeCompass, forming the basis for diagrams, domain guides, and decision blueprints.**
