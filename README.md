# KubeCompass

**A practical, unbiased, community-driven guide for building production-ready Kubernetes clusters.**

## What is KubeCompass?

KubeCompass is a knowledge base and decision-making framework for DevOps engineers and platform teams aiming to set up, maintain and scale **production-grade Kubernetes clusters** — from startups and SMBs to full-scale enterprise environments.

Our goal is to provide:

- **Objective and independent advice** for each domain and tool, with full transparency regarding trade-offs or uncertainty.
- A reproducible **gold path** for clusters, from single small setups to multi-region, multi-cluster enterprise footprints.
- Guidance that enables teams to make rational architecture choices based on real needs (open source, scaling, compliance, lock-in risk, cost, etc).
- Living documentation, with hands-on tool reviews and real experiences.

> See [VISION.md](VISION.md) and [FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md) for our philosophy, design, and structured approach.

**Why KubeCompass?**  
Because no vendor, source, or blog can stay 100% objective, up-to-date, or fit every scenario. This project is our answer: practical, transparent, and open-source.
