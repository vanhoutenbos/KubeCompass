# KubeCompass

**Opinionated, hands-on guidance for building production-ready Kubernetes platforms — without the vendor fluff.**

---

## What is KubeCompass?

Kubernetes is powerful, but the ecosystem is **overwhelming**. Every domain (networking, security, CI/CD, observability, etc.) has dozens of tools competing for attention. Most are marketed with buzzwords and vendor pitches, leaving you wondering:

- *Which tools actually work in production?*
- *Which decisions are hard to reverse later?*
- *What's hype vs. what's essential?*

KubeCompass cuts through the noise with:

✅ **Opinionated recommendations** based on real-world experience  
✅ **Hands-on testing** — every tool is actually used, not just researched  
✅ **Decision timing guidance** — know what to decide Day 1 vs. what can wait  
✅ **Transparent scoring** — maturity, lock-in risk, operational complexity, and more  
✅ **No vendor bias** — built by practitioners, for practitioners  

---

## Who Is This For?

**Primary audience:**  
DevOps engineers, SREs, platform engineers, and developers looking for **practical, hands-on guidance** to build and maintain Kubernetes clusters — without enterprise overhead or vendor pitches.

**What this IS:**
- A pragmatic guide for **practitioners** who need to make real decisions
- Focused on **"how do I get this working and keep it running"**
- Bottom-up: built by engineers, for engineers

**What this is NOT (yet):**  
- A compliance-first framework tailored for banks, healthcare, or government
- A top-down governance manual for change advisory boards
- A vendor comparison for procurement teams or CISOs

*(Those use cases are on the long-term roadmap, but not the primary focus today.)*

If you're lost in the Kubernetes ecosystem and need a rational push in the right direction — **this is for you.**

## Philosophy

### Opinionated, but Transparent
We give you **our honest take** — but we show the data so you can disagree intelligently.

### Hands-On, Not Theoretical
Every recommendation is tested in real environments. No regurgitated marketing materials.

### Timing Matters
Some decisions (CNI, GitOps) are foundational and hard to change. Others (image scanning, chaos tools) are easy to add later. We help you prioritize.

### No Vendor Agenda
We're not here to sell you SaaS licenses or enterprise support contracts. If a tool sucks, we'll say so.

## Local Testing Platform 🧪 NEW!

**Test Kubernetes platform concepts locally without cloud dependencies.**

We provide a complete Kind-based testing environment to validate platform decisions:

- ✅ **Multiple cluster configurations** (base, Cilium, Calico, multi-node)
- ✅ **Bootstrap scripts** (Windows PowerShell + Linux Bash)
- ✅ **Smoke test suite** for cluster validation
- ✅ **Layered manifests** (Layer 0/1/2 structure)
- ✅ **Reproducible and declarative** (Git-first, IaC approach)

### Quick Start - Local Testing

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/vanhoutenbos/KubeCompass.git
cd KubeCompass

# Create base cluster (Windows)
.\kind\create-cluster.ps1

# Create base cluster (Linux/WSL)
./kind/create-cluster.sh

# Run smoke tests
.\tests\smoke\run-tests.ps1     # Windows
./tests/smoke/run-tests.sh       # Linux

# Deploy test workloads
kubectl apply -f manifests/namespaces/
kubectl apply -f manifests/base/
```

📖 **[Complete Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**  
📁 **[Kind Configuration Reference](kind/README.md)**  
🧪 **[Testing Documentation](tests/README.md)**

**Testing different CNIs:**

# Each CNI needs its own cluster
./kind/create-cluster.sh cilium
cilium install

./kind/create-cluster.sh calico
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.26.1/manifests/calico.yaml
```

**Testing security policies (NEW!):**
```bash
# Apply RBAC examples (8 patterns)
kubectl apply -f manifests/rbac/

# Apply Network Policies (8 patterns)
kubectl apply -f manifests/networking/

# Run automated security tests
./tests/security/test-rbac.sh
./tests/security/test-network-policies.sh
```

📖 **[RBAC Examples Guide](manifests/rbac/README.md)** — 8 production-ready RBAC patterns  
📖 **[Network Policy Examples Guide](manifests/networking/README.md)** — Zero-trust networking with Cilium/Calico
