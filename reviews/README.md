## How to Read a Review

Each review follows this structure:

1. **Overview** — What the tool does and why it exists
2. **Installation & Setup** — How easy is it to get started?
3. **Core Functionality** — Does it work as advertised?
4. **Integration** — How does it fit with the rest of your stack?
5. **Failure Scenarios** — What happens when things break?
6. **Upgrade Path** — Can you update safely?
7. **Operational Overhead** — How much effort to maintain?
8. **Exit Strategy** — How hard is it to migrate away?
9. **Verdict** — Strengths, weaknesses, recommendations
10. **Personal Opinion** — Unfiltered take from the reviewer

## Review Criteria

Reviews are scored across these dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Maturity** | Alpha, Beta, Stable, CNCF Graduated |
| **Community Activity** | Commit frequency, issue response time, contributor diversity |
| **Vendor Independence** | Single vendor, multi-vendor, foundation-hosted |
| **Migration Risk** | How hard to remove or replace? |
| **Operational Complexity** | Simple, medium, or expert-level skill required |
| **License** | Open-source (Apache, MIT) vs. proprietary |

See [METHODOLOGY.md](../METHODOLOGY.md) for full scoring rubric.

## Contributing Reviews

Want to contribute a tool review? Here's how:

1. **Pick a tool** that's not yet reviewed (or update an outdated one)
2. **Follow the [Testing Methodology](../TESTING_METHODOLOGY.md)** — hands-on testing required
3. **Use the review template** from TESTING_METHODOLOGY.md
4. **Submit a PR** with your review

**Quality standards**:
- Must include hands-on testing (no copy-pasted marketing materials)
- Must test failure scenarios (not just happy path)
- Must declare biases upfront (e.g., "I've used this tool for 2 years")
- Must version your review (tool version + test date)

## Review Lifecycle

- **New reviews**: Accepted when tool is mature enough for production consideration (1000+ GitHub stars recommended)
- **Updates**: Reviews are re-tested periodically (target: every 6-12 months)
- **Deprecation**: Reviews are marked outdated if tool is abandoned or superseded
