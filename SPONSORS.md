## What We Need

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure Credits

**Purpose**: Test Kubernetes tools on managed platforms (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE, and others)

**Current Limitation**:
- We test on free local clusters (kind, k3s) which is reproducible but limited
- Production workload testing requires managed Kubernetes environments
- Multi-cloud validation needs access to AWS, Azure, GCP, and regional providers

**What Cloud Credits Enable**:
- ✅ Managed Kubernetes testing (EKS, AKS, GKE)
- ✅ Regional provider testing (TransIP, OVHcloud, Scaleway, DigitalOcean)
- ✅ Multi-zone and multi-region deployments
- ✅ Load balancer and storage class validation
- ✅ Network performance testing at scale
- ✅ Cost analysis with real billing data

**Estimated Monthly Need**:
- ~$500-1000/month for comprehensive testing across providers
- Ephemeral environments (create, test, destroy)
- Test automation in CI/CD

**Sponsor Recognition**:
- Logo in README "Infrastructure Sponsors" section (if desired)
- Acknowledgment in test documentation ("Tested on [Provider] courtesy of [Sponsor]")
- Mentioned in monthly progress updates

---

### 2. CI/CD Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Automate tool testing and documentation validation

**Current Limitation**:
- GitHub-hosted runners have resource limits
- Long-running tests hit timeout limits
- Parallel testing limited by free tier

**What Self-Hosted Runners Enable**:
- ✅ Automated tool testing on every commit
- ✅ Parallel test execution (faster feedback)
- ✅ Long-running integration tests
- ✅ Automated documentation builds
- ✅ Nightly testing of tool updates

**Estimated Need**:
- 2-4 dedicated CI runners (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM each)
- Or: Access to existing CI infrastructure

**Sponsor Recognition**:
- Logo in README "CI/CD Sponsors" section
- Acknowledgment in testing infrastructure documentation
- Mentioned in release notes

---

### 3. Website Hosting & CDN

**Purpose**: Host interactive website with tool selector, documentation, and diagrams

**Current Limitation**:
- GitHub Pages sufficient for now
- May need dedicated hosting as traffic grows
- CDN for global performance

**What Hosting Sponsorship Enables**:
- ✅ Fast global access (CDN)
- ✅ Custom domain with SSL
- ✅ Interactive features (API backend if needed)
- ✅ Analytics for understanding user needs

**Estimated Need**:
- ~$50-100/month for hosting + CDN
- Or: In-kind hosting donation

**Sponsor Recognition**:
- Logo in website footer (if desired)
- "Hosted by [Sponsor]" acknowledgment
- Mentioned in website credits

---

### 4. Tool Enterprise Licenses (Optional)

**Purpose**: Test enterprise versions for comprehensive comparison

**Current Approach**:
- We focus on open-source and free tiers
- Enterprise features documented from public documentation

**What Enterprise Access Enables**:
- ✅ Compare enterprise vs. open-source features
- ✅ Test enterprise-only capabilities (SSO, advanced RBAC, etc.)
- ✅ More comprehensive "choose X unless Y" rules

**Not Required**:
- Our primary focus is free and open-source solutions
- Enterprise testing is "nice to have," not critical

**Sponsor Recognition**:
- Acknowledgment in relevant tool reviews
- No influence on recommendations (editorial independence maintained)

---

## Sponsorship Tiers

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Logo in README (if desired)
- ✅ Acknowledgment in monthly updates
- ✅ Listed in SPONSORS.md

**Example**: 
- $300/month cloud credits
- Or: Self-hosted CI runner access

---

### 🥈 Silver Tier ($500-1000/month or equivalent in-kind)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ All Bronze benefits
- ✅ Logo in website footer
- ✅ Mentioned in release notes
- ✅ Quarterly sponsorship report (testing summary, impact metrics)

**Example**:
- $750/month multi-cloud credits
- Or: $500/month + website hosting

---

### 🥇 Gold Tier ($1000+/month or equivalent in-kind)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ All Silver benefits
- ✅ Input on roadmap priorities (via advisory board)
- ✅ Early access to enterprise-focused content
- ✅ Sponsor blog post opportunity (1/quarter, editorial approval required)
- ✅ Logo prominent placement in README and website

**Example**:
- $1200/month comprehensive cloud testing infrastructure
- Or: $1000/month + CI/CD infrastructure + hosting

---

## Editorial Independence Guarantee

**Sponsors NEVER influence tool recommendations**:

### What Sponsors Get
- ✅ Recognition and acknowledgment
- ✅ Support for open-source ecosystem
- ✅ Community goodwill and brand awareness
- ✅ Input on roadmap (what to test next, not what to recommend)

### What Sponsors DON'T Get
- ❌ Influence on tool scores or rankings
- ❌ Removal of negative findings
- ❌ Preferential treatment in reviews
- ❌ Marketing disguised as technical content

### Transparency Commitment
- All sponsorships clearly disclosed
- Testing methodology remains consistent
- Community can challenge any recommendation
- Sponsor input on content subject to editorial review

**If a sponsor's tool is bad, we'll say so.** That's our promise to the community.

## Why Your Sponsorship Matters

### The Problem We're Solving

**Kubernetes is overwhelming**:
- 100+ tools across 13 domains
- Vendor-biased marketing everywhere
- Limited unbiased, hands-on guidance
- High cost of wrong tool decisions

**KubeCompass provides**:
- Transparent, tested recommendations
- "Choose X unless Y" clarity
- Free, open-source knowledge
- Community-driven validation

### The Impact of Your Support

**With sponsorship, we can**:
- ✅ Test tools at production scale
- ✅ Validate across multiple cloud providers
- ✅ Automate testing for continuous updates
- ✅ Expand to more scenarios (edge, air-gapped, etc.)
- ✅ Build stronger community (events, workshops)

**Without sponsorship**:
- ⚠️ Limited to local testing (less representative)
- ⚠️ Slower update cycles (manual testing)
- ⚠️ Fewer scenarios and use cases
- ⚠️ Smaller community reach

**Your sponsorship directly enables better Kubernetes decisions for thousands of engineers.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I sponsor anonymously?**  
A: Yes! We'll acknowledge "anonymous sponsor" without details.

**Q: Do you accept one-time donations?**  
A: Yes, but recurring sponsorship helps us plan infrastructure costs.

**Q: What if my tool gets a bad review?**  
A: Sponsorship doesn't influence reviews. If your tool needs improvement, we'll be honest about it.

**Q: Can I sponsor specific testing (e.g., only my tool)?**  
A: No. Sponsorship supports general infrastructure, not specific tool promotion.

**Q: How do I know funds are used properly?**  
A: Monthly/quarterly reports show exactly how infrastructure is used. All spending is transparent.

**Q: Can I sponsor with services instead of money?**  
A: Absolutely! Cloud credits, CI infrastructure, hosting are all valuable in-kind sponsorship.

**Q: Will you prioritize my tool for testing?**  
A: We may test it sooner if there's community interest, but priority is based on user needs, not sponsorship.

**Q: Can I get early access to reviews?**  
A: Gold tier sponsors get early access to content, but editorial approval still required.
