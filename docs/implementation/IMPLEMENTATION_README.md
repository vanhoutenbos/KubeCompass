# Priority 1 Webshop Migration - Reference Architecture

This document provides a **reference architecture and design patterns** for migrating a Dutch webshop to Kubernetes, following Priority 0 requirements and Priority 1 tool selections.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**KubeCompass is a documentation-first project.** This repository contains architectural guidance, decision frameworks, and best practices—not runnable implementation code.

**Why documentation-only?**
- Focus on teaching principles and decision-making, not prescriptive solutions
- Avoid tight coupling to specific provider APIs or versions
- Allow you to adapt patterns to your specific context and requirements
- Prevent copy-paste implementations without understanding trade-offs

**You should create your own implementation based on these patterns and your specific requirements.**

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This reference architecture addresses all Priority 0 success criteria:

| Criterion | Target | Pattern |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Deployment downtime** | 0 minutes | Rolling updates + readiness probes pattern |
| **Incident detection** | < 2 minutes | Prometheus alerts + notification pattern |
| **Data recovery** | < 15 minutes | Backup automation + managed DB PITR pattern |
| **Vendor migration** | < 1 quarter | Standard K8s API + IaC pattern |
| **Developer self-service** | Via Git PR | GitOps + automated pipeline pattern |

## 🔐 Security Patterns

### Recommended Controls

- ✅ **RBAC**: Role-based access control with least privilege principle
- ✅ **Network Policies**: Default deny with explicit allows (L3/L4/L7) pattern
- ✅ **Pod Security**: Restricted profile enforcement pattern
- ✅ **Secrets Management**: External Secrets Operator pattern (no secrets in Git)
- ✅ **Image Scanning**: Trivy in CI/CD pipeline pattern
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: RBAC and break-glass action logging pattern

### Security Best Practices

- All containers run as non-root
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- No privileged containers
- Capabilities dropped
- Network segmentation enforced
- TLS everywhere (Let's Encrypt)

## 📊 Observability Patterns

### Metrics (Prometheus)
- Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring
- Application: Request rate, error rate, latency metrics
- Business: Checkout conversion, order processing, payment success metrics

### Logs (Loki)
- Centralized log aggregation pattern
- GDPR compliance (no PII logging) pattern
- Retention policy patterns

### Dashboards (Grafana)
- Webshop overview (business metrics) dashboard pattern
- Infrastructure overview dashboard pattern
- Application performance dashboard pattern
- Security events dashboard pattern

### Alert Patterns
- **Critical**: Page ops immediately (app down, high error rate)
- **Warning**: Slack notification (slow response, high resource usage)
- **Info**: Dashboard only (traffic spike, deployments)

## 💰 Cost Estimation Methodology

### Monthly Infrastructure Cost Patterns

- **Dev**: ~€175/month (3 small nodes pattern)
- **Staging**: ~€465/month (5 medium nodes pattern)
- **Production**: ~€1,780-2,580/month (6-10 large nodes, autoscaling pattern)

**Annual Total Estimate**: €29,000-38,000/year

*Note: Actual costs depend on your specific provider, node sizes, and usage patterns.*

## ❓ Questions to Answer Before Implementation

These are critical decisions from the documentation you must answer:

1. **Which managed Kubernetes provider?** (See Priority 1 lock-in analysis)
2. **Kubernetes version strategy?** (N-1, upgrade frequency)
3. **Multi-region from day 1?** (Single region initially?)
4. **Database strategy?** (Managed vs. StatefulSet, see trade-offs)
5. **Secrets management?** (Vault vs. cloud KMS)

See [OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) for complete list and prioritization.
