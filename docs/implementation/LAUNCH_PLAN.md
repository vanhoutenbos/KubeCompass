# KubeCompass Website Launch Plan

**Target**: Launch within 1 month with core tool recommendations and decision framework

**Status**: Planning → Execution

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to launch KubeCompass as a production-ready website within one month. The focus is on delivering **actionable tool recommendations** with clear decision rules ("choose X unless Y") rather than comprehensive coverage of all tools.

**Core Principle**: Ship a focused, high-quality foundation that users can trust, then expand iteratively with community input.

---

## Month 1 Launch Goals

### What We WILL Deliver

✅ **Decision Framework**:
- Complete Layer 0/1/2 structure with timing guidance
- "Choose X unless Y" decision rules for all core domains
- Transparent scoring methodology

✅ **Core Tool Recommendations**:
- Layer 0 (Foundational): CNI, GitOps, RBAC, Secrets, Storage
- Layer 1 (Core Operations): Observability, Ingress, Registry, Backup, Caching, Messaging
- Layer 2 (Enhancements): Image scanning, policy enforcement, runtime security

✅ **Real-World Scenarios**:
- Enterprise multi-tenant (finance/government)
- Startup MVP (cost-optimized)
- SME migration case study (Dutch webshop)

✅ **Interactive Tools**:
- Tool Selector Wizard (webshop-style filtering)
- AI Case Advisor (conversational recommendations)
- Interactive visual diagrams

✅ **Testing Validation**:
- At least one tool per domain tested on local Kubernetes
- Documented installation, failure scenarios, and exit strategies
- Reproducible test environments (kind, k3s)

### What We WON'T Deliver (Month 1)

❌ **Comprehensive Tool Coverage**: Only "go-to" recommendations + 1-2 alternatives per domain  
❌ **Production Testing**: Testing on managed Kubernetes (AWS, Azure, GCP) comes later  
❌ **All Scenarios**: Edge computing, air-gapped, hybrid cloud → future iterations  
❌ **Advanced Compliance**: PCI-DSS, HIPAA deep-dives → Phase 2  

**Rationale**: Focus beats comprehensiveness. Users need **one solid path** more than **fifteen mediocre options**.

## Domain-by-Domain Evaluation Strategy

### Evaluation Principles

1. **Free Solutions First**: Test on local Kubernetes (kind, k3s) before cloud
2. **Production Workload Simulation**: Use realistic configurations, not toy examples
3. **Failure Testing Required**: Document what happens when things break
4. **Exit Strategy Documented**: How hard is it to migrate away?

### Domain Prioritization

**Priority 1 (Week 2, Days 1-3)**: Foundational Layer 0
- [x] CNI: Cilium (DONE)
- [ ] GitOps: Argo CD
- [ ] Secrets: Vault + External Secrets Operator
- [ ] Identity: Keycloak (OIDC integration)

**Priority 2 (Week 2, Days 4-7)**: Core Layer 1
- [ ] Observability: Prometheus + Loki + Grafana
- [ ] Ingress: NGINX Ingress Controller
- [ ] Registry: Harbor
- [ ] Backup: Velero
- [ ] Caching: Valkey
- [ ] Messaging: NATS

**Priority 3 (Week 3)**: Enhancement Layer 2
- [ ] Image Scanning: Trivy (in CI/CD + Harbor)
- [ ] Policy: Kyverno (basic policies)
- [ ] Runtime Security: Falco (threat detection)

### Testing Environment Setup

**Base Cluster**: kind (Kubernetes in Docker)
```bash
# Create production-like cluster
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml
# - 3 control plane nodes (HA)
# - 5 worker nodes (production simulation)
# - Ingress enabled
# - Storage provisioner configured
```

**Why kind**:
- ✅ Free, runs anywhere
- ✅ Reproducible (config as code)
- ✅ Fast iteration (create/destroy in seconds)
- ✅ CI/CD friendly (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Simulates multi-node production

**Testing Workflow**:
1. Install tool via Helm/manifests
2. Configure for production (HA, security, resource limits)
3. Run basic functionality tests
4. Simulate failure (kill pod, delete node)
5. Test upgrade path (new version)
6. Document findings in reviews/[tool].md

## AI Usage & Transparency Policy

### Core Principles

**AI is a Tool, Not a Shortcut**:
- AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot) assists with documentation, code generation, and research
- **Nothing is published without**:
  - Human review and validation
  - Hands-on testing in real environments
  - Technical accuracy verification
  - Bias and vendor neutrality check

### Transparency Standards

**We Disclose**:
- When AI was used to generate initial drafts
- Human validation steps taken
- Testing performed to verify claims
- Sources and references for technical facts

**Example Disclosure** (in tool reviews):
```markdown
**AI Assistance**: Initial draft generated with Claude, validated through:
- Hands-on installation on kind cluster (Dec 2024)
- Failure testing documented in testing log
- Community feedback incorporated
- Technical review by [@vanhoutenbos]
```

### Validation Requirements

**Before Publishing**:
- [ ] Hands-on testing completed (local or cloud)
- [ ] Failure scenarios documented
- [ ] At least one human review
- [ ] Sources cited for factual claims
- [ ] Bias check (vendor neutrality validated)

**Anti-Patterns We Avoid**:
- ❌ Copy-pasting AI output without validation
- ❌ Publishing untested recommendations
- ❌ Relying solely on GitHub stars or marketing materials
- ❌ Hiding AI involvement (transparency first)

## Dataset Creation & Maintenance Strategy

### Initial Dataset Challenge

**Problem**: Creating the baseline tool database is time-intensive
- 13 domains × ~5-10 tools/domain = 65-130 tools to evaluate
- Each tool requires hands-on testing (4-8 hours per tool)
- Documentation, failure testing, comparison = significant effort

**Solution**: Phased Approach

**Phase 1 (Month 1)**: Minimum Viable Dataset
- Focus: "Go-to" recommendation + 1-2 alternatives per domain
- Target: ~30 tools with complete testing
- Quality over quantity: Deep testing, not superficial coverage

**Phase 2 (Months 2-3)**: Community Expansion
- Open contribution model (community reviews)
- Domain-specific maintainers (e.g., "Observability Lead")
- Pull request workflow for new tool additions

**Phase 3 (Months 4+)**: Continuous Maintenance
- Quarterly review cycles for each domain
- Automated tool version monitoring (GitHub Actions)
- Community-driven update submissions

### Maintenance Automation

**Automated Checks** (GitHub Actions):
- Monitor tool releases (GitHub API, RSS feeds)
- Flag outdated reviews (>6 months old)
- Check for broken links in documentation
- Validate test clusters still work (CI testing)

**Manual Reviews** (Quarterly):
- Re-test "go-to" recommendations with latest versions
- Update decision rules if tool landscape changes
- Remove deprecated tools, add emerging alternatives

### Dataset Quality Standards

**Every Tool Review Must Have**:
- ✅ Hands-on testing date and environment
- ✅ Installation guide (reproducible)
- ✅ Failure scenario tested and documented
- ✅ "Choose X unless Y" decision rule
- ✅ Alternative tools with trade-offs
- ✅ Exit strategy (migration complexity)

**Freshness Indicators**:
- 🟢 **Fresh** (<3 months old): Fully trusted
- 🟡 **Aging** (3-6 months): Still valid, check for updates
- 🔴 **Stale** (>6 months): Needs re-testing

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Can't Test All Tools in 1 Month
**Mitigation**: Focus on "go-to" recommendations only (1 per domain) + 1-2 well-known alternatives. Comprehensive coverage comes later with community help.

### Risk: Findings Become Outdated Quickly
**Mitigation**: Version and date all reviews. Implement automated version monitoring. Quarterly review cycles.

### Risk: Lack of Community Contributions
**Mitigation**: Lower barriers (clear guidelines, templates, good first issues). Recognize contributors prominently. Create domain ownership roles.

### Risk: Perceived as AI-Generated Fluff
**Mitigation**: Radical transparency (disclose AI use). Hands-on testing required for everything. Document failure scenarios (AI can't fake these).

### Risk: Can't Afford Production Testing
**Mitigation**: Start with free local testing (kind, k3s). Seek cloud credits from sponsors. Community can test on their environments.
