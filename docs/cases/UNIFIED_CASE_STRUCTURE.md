# Unified Case Analysis & Restructuring Framework

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Transform raw case documentation into uniform, AI-friendly decision frameworks  
**Audience**: Engineers, Architects, Management, AI Agents  

---

## Overview

This document defines the **standardized structure** for transforming raw case analysis (Layer 0/1/2) into a uniform decision framework suitable for:

- **Interactive case evaluation** - Users answer questions to get recommendations
- **Scenario comparison** - Compare different organizational contexts
- **Automated decision support** - AI-driven "Choose X unless Y" recommendations
- **Provider mapping** - Match scenarios to infrastructure providers with trade-offs

---

## Document Structure Template

Every unified case document should follow this structure:

### 1. Executive Summary

```markdown

### 3. Layer 1: Tool Mapping

**Purpose**: Tactical tool selections based on Layer 0 requirements

```markdown
## 3. Layer 1: Tool Mapping

### Infrastructure & Provisioning

#### Kubernetes Distribution
**Decision**: [Managed / Self-hosted / Hybrid]

**"Choose X unless Y" Rule**:
- ✅ **Choose Managed Kubernetes** UNLESS:
  - ❌ Team has strong Kubernetes expertise (self-managed OK)
  - ❌ Vendor independence overrides operational simplicity
  - ❌ Cost optimization requires bare metal
  
**Layer 0 Link**: [Which requirements drive this decision?]

**Provider Options per Scenario**:
- **SME/Startup**: TransIP, DigitalOcean, Scaleway
  - Rationale: Simplicity, EU datacenter, reasonable pricing
  - Trade-off: Less features than hyperscalers
  
- **Enterprise**: AKS, EKS, GKE OR self-managed
  - Rationale: More control, compliance, advanced features
  - Trade-off: Higher complexity, potentially higher cost

**Alternatives Considered**:
- [Alternative 1]: [Why rejected]
- [Alternative 2]: [When it would be better]

#### Infrastructure as Code
[Same structure as above]

### Networking & Service Communication

#### CNI Selection
**Decision**: [Cilium / Calico / Flannel]

**"Choose X unless Y" Rule**:
- ✅ **Choose Cilium** UNLESS:
  - ❌ Team has deep Calico expertise (leverage existing knowledge)
  - ❌ BGP routing is critical (Calico stronger)
  - ❌ Simplicity paramount (Flannel sufficient)

### GitOps & Deployment

### Observability

### Security & Compliance

### Data Management
```

### 4. Layer 2: Enhancements

**Purpose**: Advanced capabilities with clear trigger conditions

```markdown
## 4. Layer 2: Enhancements

### [Capability Name] (e.g., Service Mesh)

#### 🎯 Trigger Condition
**Implement when**:
- [Specific condition 1]
- [Specific condition 2]

**Do NOT implement when**:
- [Exclusion criterion 1]
- [Exclusion criterion 2]

#### 🔀 Trade-offs Matrix
| Option | Complexity | Features | Cost | When to Use |
|--------|------------|----------|------|-------------|
| Option A | Low | Basic | Low | Small scale |
| Option B | High | Advanced | High | Enterprise |

#### 💭 Decision Questions
- [ ] Do we have > 5 microservices?
- [ ] Do we need per-service security?
- [ ] Can we manage the operational overhead?

#### ⚠️ Timing Guidance
- **Too Early**: If < 3 services (unnecessary complexity)
- **Right Time**: When debugging inter-service issues takes > 1 hour
- **Too Late**: If security incidents have already occurred

#### 🔗 Layer 1 Dependencies
- Requires: [Layer 1 capability X, Y]
- Builds on: [Existing infrastructure]
```

---

### 5. Open Questions Mapping

**Purpose**: Prioritize unknowns by implementation impact

```markdown
## 5. Open Questions Mapping

### Critical (Implementation Blockers)
Questions that MUST be answered before starting implementation.

| ID | Question | Impact | Affects | Default if Unknown |
|----|----------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Q1 | [Question] | Blocks cluster provisioning | Infrastructure | [Assume X] |
| Q5 | [Question] | Blocks node sizing | Cost, Performance | [Assume Y] |

### Important (Needed in First 2 Weeks)
Questions that affect architecture but don't block initial setup.

| ID | Question | Impact | Affects | Deadline |
|----|----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Q10 | [Question] | Affects GitOps workflow | CI/CD | Week 2 |

### Can Defer (Layer 2+)
Questions that can be answered during optimization phase.

| ID | Question | Impact | Can Defer Until |
|----|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Q7 | [Question] | UI exposure | Layer 2 observability enhancement |
```

### 6. Provider Recommendations

**Purpose**: Map scenarios to infrastructure providers with explicit trade-offs

```markdown
## 6. Provider Recommendations

### Scenario A: SME/Startup
**Context**: Small team, limited budget, need operational simplicity

#### Managed Kubernetes Providers
| Provider | Region | Cost | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|--------|------|------|------|----------|
| TransIP | NL | €€ | Dutch support, EU datacenter | Smaller ecosystem | Dutch SMEs |
| Scaleway | FR/NL | €€ | Good pricing, EU | Less mature | Budget-conscious |
| DigitalOcean | Global | €€€ | Mature, good UX | No EU-only | Global startups |

#### Decision Matrix
```
IF (team_size < 10 AND kubernetes_experience = "none" AND budget = "limited")
THEN recommend: Managed Kubernetes at TransIP/Scaleway
UNLESS: vendor_independence_priority = "critical"
  THEN recommend: Self-managed with external consultant
```

#### Alternative: Self-Managed
- **When**: Vendor independence overrides operational cost
- **Cost**: Lower compute, higher operational overhead
- **Risk**: Requires expertise (hire consultant)

---

### Scenario B: Enterprise/Government
**Context**: Large organization, compliance-heavy, risk-averse

#### Decision Matrix
```
IF (compliance = "strict" AND team_size > 50 AND budget = "ample")
THEN recommend: Self-managed Kubernetes (Kubeadm/Talos) OR Hyperscaler
UNLESS: operational_burden = "unacceptable"
  THEN recommend: Managed Kubernetes with compliance features (AKS/EKS/GKE)
```

[Continue for each scenario...]
```

### 7. "Choose X unless Y" Decision Rules

**Purpose**: Compiled ruleset for all major decisions

```markdown
## 7. "Choose X unless Y" Decision Rules

### Infrastructure

#### Rule: Kubernetes Distribution
```
DEFAULT: Managed Kubernetes
UNLESS:
  - Team has Kubernetes expertise → Consider self-managed
  - Vendor independence > operational simplicity → Self-managed
  - Budget allows dedicated platform team → Self-managed viable
  - Compliance requires on-premises → Self-managed required
```

#### Rule: CNI Selection
```
DEFAULT: Cilium
UNLESS:
  - Team has Calico expertise → Leverage existing knowledge
  - BGP routing critical → Calico stronger
  - Maximum simplicity needed → Flannel sufficient
  - No network policies needed → Default CNI adequate
```

### GitOps

#### Rule: GitOps Tool Selection
```
DEFAULT: Argo CD
UNLESS:
  - Pure Git workflow critical → Flux more "Git-native"
  - No UI needed → Flux lighter weight
  - Helm + image automation critical → Flux stronger
  - Multi-tenancy not needed → Flux simpler
```

### Observability

#### Rule: Metrics Stack
```
DEFAULT: Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
UNLESS:
  - Budget allows SaaS → Datadog/New Relic (less operational overhead)
  - Team < 5 people → Managed observability (reduce burden)
  - Compliance requires on-premises → Open-source required
```

### Database

#### Rule: Database Deployment
```
DEFAULT: Managed cloud database
UNLESS:
  - Vendor independence critical → PostgreSQL StatefulSet + replication
  - Compliance requires on-premises → Self-hosted required
  - Cost optimization needed AND team has DB expertise → Self-managed viable
```

[Continue for all domains...]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Start with tool selection without Layer 0  
✅ **Do**: Ensure every tool choice traces to a Layer 0 requirement

❌ **Don't**: Hide assumptions or conflicts  
✅ **Do**: Document gaps explicitly for stakeholder resolution

❌ **Don't**: Create one-size-fits-all recommendations  
✅ **Do**: Provide scenario-specific guidance with clear trade-offs

❌ **Don't**: Skip non-goals  
✅ **Do**: Explicitly document what's out of scope and why

❌ **Don't**: Use vendor buzzwords without context  
✅ **Do**: Explain why a tool matters for this specific case
