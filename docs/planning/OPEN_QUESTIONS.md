## CRITICAL (Blocks Implementation Start)

### 🔴 Q1: Which Managed Kubernetes Provider?
**Category**: Architecture + Budget  
**Impact**: Determines available features, pricing, support quality  
**Layer 0 Constraint**: 
- EU datacenter (GDPR data residency)
- Vendor independence (Terraform support required)
- Team maturity (support quality critical)

**Selection Criteria**:
| Criterion | Requirement | Validation |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Datacenter Location** | EU (preferably Netherlands) | Compliance check |
| **SLA** | > 99.5% uptime | Contract review |
| **Terraform Support** | Native provider available (⚠️ or acceptable without) | Technical validation |
| **Load Balancer Support** | Layer 4/7 LB available | Feature check |
| **Storage Options** | Block storage + object storage | Feature check |
| **Pricing** | Transparent, predictable | Budget fit |

**Options to Evaluate**:
- TransIP Managed Kubernetes (NL datacenter, clear pricing) ⚠️ **No Terraform for cluster lifecycle**
- OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes (EU, good pricing) ✅ **Terraform support**
- DigitalOcean Kubernetes (global presence, simple pricing) ✅ **Terraform support**
- Scaleway Kubernetes (FR datacenter, developer-friendly) ✅ **Terraform support**

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: TransIP has **no native Terraform provider** for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management (create/delete cluster, node pools). Hybrid IaC approach needed: manual cluster provisioning + Terraform for in-cluster resources. See [TransIP Infrastructure as Code Guide](../docs/TRANSIP_INFRASTRUCTURE_AS_CODE.md) for details.

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- Infrastructure provisioning (Terraform code or documented manual process)
- Cost estimation (budget approval)
- Network design (load balancer type)
- Storage class selection

**Decision Point**: Week 1 - for architecture finalization

### 🔴 Q5: Resource Requirements (CPU/Memory)?
**Category**: Architecture + Budget  
**Impact**: Node sizing, number of nodes, monthly costs  
**Layer 0 Constraint**: Budget realism, availability (HA requires multiple nodes)

**To Measure**:
| Metric | Current Situation | K8s Equivalent |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **CPU per instance** | ___ cores | Pod requests/limits |
| **Memory per instance** | ___ GB | Pod requests/limits |
| **Number of instances** | ___ VMs | Number of replicas |
| **Peak traffic** | ___ req/sec | Autoscaling trigger |
| **Database connections** | ___ concurrent | Connection pool sizing |

**Measurement Method**:
- [ ] Analyze current VM metrics (last 3 months)
- [ ] Identify peak usage (Black Friday, sales)
- [ ] Calculate overhead (K8s system pods, logging, monitoring = ~20-30%)

**Output Needed**:
```yaml
# Example sizing
application_pod:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "1Gi"
  limits:
    cpu: "2000m"
    memory: "2Gi"
  replicas: 3  # HA minimum
```

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- Cluster sizing (number and type of nodes)
- Cost estimation
- Autoscaling configuration

**Decision Point**: Week 1 - for cluster provisioning

### 🔴 Q26: Current Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)?
**Category**: Architecture + Operational  
**Impact**: Migration strategy, managed DB choice, HA configuration  
**Layer 0 Constraint**: Data resilience (PITR requirement), team maturity (no DB HA expertise)

**To Identify**:
| Aspect | Question | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Database Type** | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, other? | Managed DB options, migration tools |
| **Version** | Which version? | Compatibility, upgrade path |
| **Size** | How many GB data? | Storage sizing, backup duration |
| **Query Load** | Queries/sec, connections? | Instance sizing, read replicas |
| **Schema Complexity** | Number of tables, foreign keys, triggers? | Migration complexity |

**Migration Path Options**:
1. **Lift & Shift**: Database remains external VM
   - ✅ Simplest option
   - ❌ No HA improvement
   
2. **Managed Cloud Database**: Migration to cloud provider DB
   - ✅ HA + PITR out-of-box
   - ⚠️ Vendor dependency (accepted for database)
   
3. **StatefulSet + Operator**: Database in Kubernetes
   - ✅ Vendor independence
   - ❌ High operational complexity

**Layer 0 Decision**: Managed DB (Option 2) unless team has DB HA expertise

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- Managed DB provisioning
- Connection string configuration
- Backup strategy
- Schema migration planning

**Decision Point**: Week 1-2 - for migration planning

### 🔴 Q27: Database Size & Load?
**Category**: Architecture + Budget  
**Impact**: Instance sizing, backup window, replication strategy  
**Layer 0 Constraint**: RPO 15 minutes (transaction data)

**To Measure**:
| Metric | Current State | K8s Impact |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Data Size** | ___ GB | Storage provisioning, backup duration |
| **Growth Rate** | ___ GB/month | Capacity planning |
| **Queries/sec** | ___ QPS | Instance sizing, read replicas needed? |
| **Peak Load** | ___ concurrent connections | Connection pool sizing |
| **Write Volume** | ___ writes/sec | Replication lag considerations |

**Backup Window Calculation**:
```
Backup Duration = Data Size / Network Bandwidth
Example: 100GB / 1Gbps = ~15 minutes
Impact: Determines backup frequency for RPO 15min target
```

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- Managed DB instance type selection
- Backup frequency configuration
- Read replica necessity

**Decision Point**: Week 1-2 - parallel to Q26

**Category**: Architecture + Operational  
**Impact**: Zero-downtime deployments, horizontal scaling, rolling updates  
**Layer 0 Requirement**: Zero-downtime deployments (business critical)

**Critical Validations**:

#### Q31: Is the Application Stateless?
- [ ] **Sessions**: Stored in database/Redis (not in memory)
- [ ] **File Uploads**: External object storage (not local disk)
- [ ] **Caching**: Centralized (Redis/Memcached), not in-memory
- [ ] **Shared State**: No shared filesystem dependencies

**Impact**: If NOT stateless → code refactoring needed for horizontal scaling

---

#### Q32: Can the Application Scale Horizontally?
- [ ] **Database Connections**: Connection pooling configured
- [ ] **Locking Mechanisms**: Distributed locks (Redis), not file-based
- [ ] **Scheduled Jobs**: External scheduler (Kubernetes CronJob), not in-app
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Works with 3+ replicas without conflicts

**Impact**: If NOT scalable → architecture changes needed

---

#### Q33: Hardcoded Localhost/IP Dependencies?
- [ ] **Database Connection**: Environment variable (not hardcoded IP)
- [ ] **Cache URL**: Environment variable
- [ ] **External APIs**: Environment variable
- [ ] **Service Discovery**: Hostname-based (not IP-based)

**Impact**: If hardcoded → code changes needed for Kubernetes service discovery

---

#### Q34: Health Check Endpoints Present?
- [ ] **Liveness Probe**: `/health` endpoint (is application alive?)
- [ ] **Readiness Probe**: `/ready` endpoint (can application receive traffic?)
- [ ] **Startup Probe**: Slow startup handling

**Impact**: If NOT present → critical: must be implemented for rolling updates

**Blocking Dependencies**:
- Kubernetes Deployment manifests
- Rolling update strategy
- Zero-downtime guarantee

**Decision Point**: Week 2-3 - for application containerization
